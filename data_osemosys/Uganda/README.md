Oveview of the scenarios:

1) Business as Usual (BAU): This is the baseline, business as usual scenario for Uganda.

2)Dry climate scenario: In this scenario, the impact of climate change on the electricity sector is explored. Here, the hydropower capacity factors are periodically varied to represent the variability in precipitation. 

3) Biomass/RET scenario: The increase in the penetration of biomass use in the power sector is explored in this scenario.
