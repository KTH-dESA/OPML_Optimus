1. BAU - Reference scenario considering possibility of investments for all technologies. If import is limited to 80% renewable sources are not part of the mix. The point where renewable technologies enter the mix is if the import is limited to 60%. In order to account of possible geopolitics constraints, import is gradually limited to 60% until 2050, starting with a limit of 80% in 2020, since currently Afghanistan is still heavily dependent on import.

2. Import Limit Scenario - The import scenario just wants to show what would happen to the energy mix when it is not possible to import most of the energy from neighbouring countries. Starting from a limit of 70% in 2019 until reaching 60% and keeping it constant throughout the time line considered. 

3. RE Scenario - I have built a separate scenario called RE Scenario Afghanistan Final, using a block of technology and applying activity lower limit - this has been done because REtarget was not working or at least I didn't see any change in the results. I have pplied lower limits as follows: 20% to 2030, 30% to 2030 and 40% to 2050.

4. War Scenario - It has been used the negative demand projection and it has been halved as an assumption the capacity investment compared to the previous scenarios.

5. National Policies Scenario - The national plans have been used to see how the scenario would look like with the commission of power plants in specific years. (i.e. they want to build an hydro power plant of almost 800MW in 2024 and I force the model to invest that year and install the capacity in that specific year)
